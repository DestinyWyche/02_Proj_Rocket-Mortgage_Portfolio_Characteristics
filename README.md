# Rocket Mortgage Portfolio Characteristics

## Purpose of Project

For this project, I explored loan-level data for the Rocket Mortgage financial institution to identify loan and borrower characteristics. 

## Data Analysis Process

### Asking the question

In this project, I answered the following questions about the loans and borrowers:

- Loans  
  - Which loan type generates the most funding?  
  - What is the most common drivers for loans?  
  - What is the average loan amount?
  - What state has the most loans come from?
- Borrowers
  - What is the 2022 targeted age group for the loan applicants?
  - What is the average loan amount per applicant race?
  - What is the average loan costs per debt-to-income ratio?
  - What is the debt-to-income ratio per applicant age group?

### Preparing the data

- Data was collected from Home Loan Disclosure Act(HMDA) Modified Loan/Application Registar (LAR) which can be found by clicking this [link](https://ffiec.cfpb.gov/data-publication/modified-lar/2022)

### Processing the data  

- Raw data was an csv file with delimiters, so I used the text to columns function in **Excel** to seperate data in readable rows and columns.
  - This enabled me to explore the data and understand what questions it could answer
  - There were many different columns with a vareity of information. Therefore, after identifying the questions I wanted to answer, I hid the columns that I no longer needed.  
  
  **(this cleaning process can be viewed on the sheet "working sheet" of file 01)**
 
### Analyzing the data

- To begin analyzing the data, I created **Pivot Tables** to summarize the information. These are critical to being able to guage information quickly and they also provide a reference to ensure data visualizations are displaying the correct insight **(these tables can be viewed on the sheet "characteristics_pivottables" of file 01)**  
- Not all stakeholders are familiar with reading tables, so to make the insights more digestiale, I created visualizations in **Tableau (these visualizations can be viewed in file 02)**.
